<!-- PROJECT DESCRIPTION -->

# Customer Churn Prediction <a name="about-project"></a>

**Customer Churn Prediction** 
Vodafone is a global telecommunications company operating in numerous countries, providing mobile and fixed-line telecommunication services to millions of customers worldwide.
Vodafone faces tough competition and wants to know how likely customers are to leave and why.
In this project, we aim to find the likelihood of a customer leaving the organization, the key indicators of churn as well as the retention strategies that can be implemented to avert this problem. And also to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the likelihood of customer churn within Vodafone's customer base.
